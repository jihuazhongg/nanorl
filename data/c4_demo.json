      "text": "To the apparent surprise of everyone, the Walt Disney Company has announced a deal to purchase Lucasfilm Ltd. According to the official press release, Disney has agreed to fork over $4.05 billion in cash and stock for George Lucas’ studio in a deal that brings together two of the world’s most important intellectual property libraries.\nAs you might expect, Disney is itching to take advantage of its new toys. “This transaction combines a world-class portfolio of content including Star Wars, one of the greatest family entertainment franchises of all time, with Disney’s unique and unparalleled creativity across multiple platforms, businesses, and markets to generate sustained growth and drive significant long-term value,” said Disney CEO Robert Iger in this afternoon’s announcement.\nUnder the terms of this agreement Disney will acquire control over all Lucasfilm iterations. This includes both its traditional film-making studio facilities, as well as the various technologies Lucasfilm has created over the years to further its various media properties. Thus, the gigantic Disney family now includes Lucasfilm itself, special effects house Industrial Light & Magic, Skywalker Sound and LucasArts, the company’s video game creation division.\nThis acquisition alone would be huge news, but as if to pre-empt fan speculation on the future of Star Wars the same announcement also mentions that a new Star Wars movie is scheduled to appear in 2015. Though the vast majority of recent Star Wars media has been focused on the property’s various animated iterations and LEGO crossovers, this new film will be the first official cinematic continuation of George Lucas’ original Star Wars trilogy. Though very few details are offered on this film, it has officially been dubbed Star Wars: Episode VII, and barring any major catastrophes it should hit theaters at some point in 2015 (if we had to guess, we’d assume an early summer release in keeping with the tradition established by its predecessors).\nPerhaps even more intriguing however, is the announcement’s claim that Episode VII’s release will herald a new era in which new Star Wars movies hit theaters “every two to three years.” It specifically mentions Episodes VIII and IX by name, though offers no solid details on either film.\nWhile the effects of the move won’t be fully known for at least a few months, we can think of a number of a things this new union might change. For instance, currently Dark Horse Comics publishes all Star Wars comic books, but with Disney owning Marvel Comics we can’t see that agreement lasting for long. Likewise, both Disney and Lucasfilm have sizable divisions dedicated to creating video games based on their various media properties. Normally these companies have had to seek outside publishing agreements, but now that they’ve joined forces and massively expanded the number of games either company is capable of releasing in any given year, it makes a lot of sense for Disney to invest in its own games publishing wing.\nFinally, this agreement almost certainly heralds future crossovers between Disney and Lucasfilm characters. We don’t know any specifics, but it’s only a matter of time before we see toys depicting Mickey Mouse dressed as Darth Vader. Whether that sounds awesome or stomach-churningly disgusting is entirely up to your rapidly waning sense of childhood whimsy.\nUpdate: Scratch that last prediction. Apparently Disney characters dressed as Star Wars characters is already a thing.\nOur partnership with LucasFilm has produced over 20 yrs worth of stories. We have Star Wars for the near future, and hope for years to come."

      "text": "I hadn’t been to Red Mountain in over 4 years and was happy to experience it again. Milana Knowles, our VP Day Spa Sales and Marketing, held a Day Spa Retreat there with 35 of our partner day spa owners and managers. She invited me to speak to the group as part of the education part of the program.\nI noticed a general level of improvement in décor, food and accommodations at Red Mountain. Of course staying in one of their new villas made the whole experience much more luxe than I had ever experienced it before. Their dedicated spa facility was a real improvement over their previous “temporary” treatment rooms. Now there is a nice view with a relaxation room, good product choices, and in general a more spa-like feel. The only problem was that either they didn’t have enough therapists or all of their treatment times were booked solid. Seems they missed out on a lot of business because so many people wanted more treatments (including me) and couldn’t get them. Although more expensive than in the past, it still is a good value. I understand they are almost fully booked in October. And of course the hiking, as always, was spectacular.\nWe had arranged day spa retreats in the past but this was our first one in a long time – and the first that Milana coordinated. By all counts it seems it was a tremendous success…with the day spa owners having (in many cases) their first destination spa experience. Milana provided most of the education as she is an expert on retail sales and has managed some of the largest day spas in the country. There wasn’t a question she couldn’t answer! Comfort Zone was the sponsor and they were very generous in gifting all of the participants with facials and an array of their full size products.\nWe reviewed the results of our recent Day Spa Survey 2007 and I even gave them a “sneak peek” of the Top Spa Trends we are considering for 2008. (top secret!) What I like about these retreats is that the day spa owners are willing to share information very openly because they come from all over the country and for the most part do not compete with each other. By the time we all enjoyed the evening Fire Ceremony at the end of the retreat, we had gotten to know each other and become friends. Even shedding some tears together around the fire on that full-moon night, felt surprisingly good."

      "text": "Last month's fixture window provided a tease, but the final set of international matches for 2018 should finally give a glimpse into the real potential of the U.S. men's national team and its immediate future.\nChristian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams, who all had to withdraw from October matches vs. Colombia and Peru because of injuries, will suit up Nov. 15 against England in London and Nov. 20 against Italy in Genk, Belgium, after being included on Dave Sarachan's roster for the European friendlies on Monday.\nPulisic has played only 89 minutes for the national team in the last 13 months, so his inclusion, amid a strong run of form with Borussia Dortmund, will provide a nice jolt for a national team that continues to turn the page and look forward.\nIt's all coming full circle for Sarachan, who began his caretaker role as national team coach with last November's friendly in Portugal, the first match after the U.S. failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. He'll presumably finish his tenure with the return trip to Europe, as it is widely expected that he will not be given the full-time role by USMNT general manager Earnie Stewart. That role was supposedly going to be filled–or at the very least have a chief candidate for it identified–by Nov. 1, but that loose deadline has come and gone, with perceived frontrunner Gregg Berhalter still alive in the MLS playoffs as coach of the Columbus Crew.\nThose playoffs have thrown a wrench into Sarachan's roster selection, too, with eight clubs still alive and featuring potential U.S. call-ups. That number of clubs will be reduced to four by next Sunday night, and with some MLS-based players arriving later in camp, Sarachan has expanded the roster to 28 players to ensure full training sessions while also giving opportunities to some newer faces.\nAmong the intriguing newcomers are a pair of midfielders in Fulham's 20-year-old Luca de la Torre, who has one cap, and Malmo's 23-year-old Romain Gall, for which this will be his first senior national team camp. Gall has impressed in Sweden in 2018, scoring 14 goals in 30 matches for Sundsvall and Malmo. Veteran and captain Michael Bradley, who had returned last month after a yearlong national-team hiatus, has not been included for this trip.\n\"With the availability of some players that we didn’t get to see in the last fixture window due to injury, the thinking is this roster gives us depth with young players that still need the experience of big games, especially games abroad,\" Sarachan said in a statement. \"With Michael Bradley, there are a couple reasons. The first is that after having earned 142 caps, his need for these games is far less important than it would be for players with less experience. Secondly, Michael’s schedule the past two years with Toronto FC has been virtually non-stop and he has largely played without a break. At this stage, it made sense to give him some extra time off and also allow these games to be a platform for players that lack that kind of experience.\"\nSteffen and Guzan appear to be the top two on Sarachan's depth chart, in that order, but it remains baffling that Bill Hamid isn't called into camp as one of the three options, especially with D.C. United out of the MLS playoffs. Bringing both Guzan and Steffen, whose teams could both advance, seems unnecessary, though the calls are merited based on their form. Steffen, at 23 and with more clutch playoff showings under his belt, remains the present and future of the No. 1 job.\nAs for the No. 3, which ultimately is of little consequence in these camps, Horvath has at least started Brugge's last two league games after a spell of inactivity and is getting the nod in Tuesday's Champions League match vs. Monaco, but he needs to show considerably more on a consistent basis to put his name back among the upper echelon.\nThis is more or less the same group that appeared last month, with Moore, Villafaña and Zimmerman joining and NYCFC's Ben Sweat being left behind. Villafaña should push the up-and-down Robinson for starter's minutes at left back, with the young Wigan player being beaten for pace by recent South American opposition while also showing the penchant for delivering a good ball while getting into the attack.\nOn the other side, Moore and Cannon should push Yedlin to start in at least one of the matches. Yedlin's familiarity with England's players from his time in the Premier League, not to mention his overall experience, would figure to give him the leg up in the opening friendly at Wembley.\nWith Miazga's recent struggles at Nantes and Long's solid showing vs. Peru, you wonder if the starting center back job next to Brooks is up for grabs, though.\nGetting the opportunity to play in Wembley would be a nice bonus for Robinson and Carter-Vickers, who were both born in England.\nAt last, Sarachan has his full complement of young midfielders from which to choose. Pulisic, McKennie, Adams and Weah figure to make up the nucleus of the national team for the foreseeable future, and this is the first time they've all been in a camp together. Barring any injuries picked up Tuesday in Champions League vs. Atletico Madrid or Saturday in the Bundesliga vs. Bayern Munich, Pulisic will make his first U.S. appearance since May and only his second since the World Cup qualifying failure. That's nothing new, but it's no less staggering of a fact.\nIf the four start across in the midfield, that would figure to leave Acosta or Trapp behind them in a No. 6 role, though Trapp, despite multiple apperances donning the captain's armband, has yet to show the consistent quality at the international level to lock down that spot. If given another chance, it's a good opportunity to prove his worth.\nThe thinnest part of the U.S. roster remains as such. There's no Andrija Novakovich, who had been present in past camps but never had the chance to make a dent on the field, while Jozy Altidore is dealing with an ankle injury that cut his season with Toronto FC short and prevented him from being reintegrated into the fold. Going down the line, the options are uninspiring and wholly inexperienced for the moment.\nThat leaves the 18-year-old Sargent, who opened eyes with his play vs. Peru and is looking to make headway with the Werder Bremen first team after shining for its reserves, and Wood, who scored a very nice goal vs. Colombia, to lead the line.\nGetting Sargent, Pulisic, Adams, McKennie and Weah on the field together for as much as possible should be a chief priority in these two games. That they haven't had that opportunity in the last year, with untimely injuries a key factor in that, is one of the real disappointments of the transition phase."

For main course we had Roast Chicken Tikka, Bombay alloo, Charred Aubergine with chilli and mint and a green bean and mushroom side dish, not forgetting the giant Yorkshire pudding!

Eckes Jr.\nDespite the passage of NAFTA and other recent free trade victories in the United States, former U.S. trade official Alfred Eckes warns that these developments have a dark side. Opening America's Market offers a bold critique of U.S. trade policies over the last sixty years, placing them within a historical perspective.\nEckes reconsiders trade policy issues and events from Benjamin Franklin to Bill Clinton, attributing growing political unrest and economic insecurity in the 1990s to shortsighted policy decisions made in the generation after World War II. Eager to win the Cold War and promote the benefits of free trade, American officials generously opened the domestic market to imports but tolerated foreign discrimination against American goods. American consumers and corporations gained in the resulting global economy, but many low-skilled workers have become casualties.\nEckes also challenges criticisms of the 'infamous' protectionist Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which allegedly worsened the Great Depression and provoked foreign retaliation. In trade history, he says, this episode was merely a mole hill, not a mountain.\nAlfred E. Eckes, Jr., a former chairman and commissioner of the U.S. International Trade Commission, is Ohio Eminent Research Professor in Contemporary History at Ohio University. His books include The United States and the Global Struggle for Minerals.\nFor more information about Alfred E. Eckes Jr., visit the Author Page."

      "text": "Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, \"Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.\" When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. They told him, \"In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet: \"'And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'\"\nThen Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, \"Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.\"\nWhat were the religious leaders of Jerusalem thinking?\nThis is what has always puzzled me about this story. Not the wise men, and not Herod – although more on them another day – but the reaction of those in Jerusalem. Here are these strange foreigners with news of the Messianic birth. “All of Jerusalem,” we read, “was troubled” at these news. Agitated by it. Muttering in the streets.\nBut what happens? The scribes and chief priests tell the wise men that the Messiah is to be born in Bethlehem. They know the time and the place. Their response, though, is to... do nothing?\nHow could these people not be packing their bags for a trip to David's city? How could they miss the chance, even if it was a tiny chance, to see if these strange foreigners could be right? If the Messiah had been born?\nMatthew doesn't tell us. But I can guess. I imagine, at least for some of them, that it was just a matter of routine. They had things to do! Responsibilities! The temple isn't going to run itself. The Scriptures aren't going to be copied without someone copying them. People need to be taught. Decisions need to be made. “There's so many good things we're doing, we don't have time!” they'd say.\nThey didn't have time to come a meet their Savior.\nIt is easy for us to feel judgmental, but we do the same thing. We get so busy with the good things in life that need to be done that we sacrifice the time it takes to meet with the Savior. We can't fit space in our busy schedules to experience God's salvation.\nI suspect the problem for the religious leaders, as it is for many of us, was simple. They had let the good things in their lives crowd out the best things.\nWe are busy people. We've got 24 hours in a day and 1,000 things we could do with them. And that's not itself wrong. But it can turn into a trap. Here's what I find myself doing. I am busy, and I look at the things that I'm busy with, and I ask the question “Are they good?” Because, obviously, there are ways to spend your time that are bad. Shouldn't do that. I ask whether they are good things, and if they are, I assume I'm living life the way I should. But if all we ask is “are these things good,” even if our answer is yes, the outcome can still be bad and destructive. Because good things can often be the enemy of the best things.\nThink about a parent who never makes time for their kids because of work. Some of us had those parents. Some of us can struggle with being them. That parent isn't doing bad stuff. Their hours are being spent on productive things. God made us to work, and to do it excellently. The problem is, that good stuff that robs their children of the time they need. The good, when it isn't looked at carefully, easily becomes the enemy of the best.\nOne of our callings in this time between Christ's comings is to spend our days pursuing what is best. Which isn't always easy - it often means giving up good things for other things that are better. There is often a sense of loss in that. Yet that loss is more than repaid by what is found."

      "text": "If you’ve ever been to the MOMA in New York City, you’ve experienced a plethora of wildly different styles and mediums of modern art. Much of it evokes strong reactions from the spectator from the mundane, “I don’t get it” to a fierce, “that’s the ugliest thing I’ve ever laid eyes on.” Many must have looked at the colorful works of Miró, Kandinsky, or Klee in their day and thought, “that’s not right. It needs to change.” But over time, their pieces have become regarded as great art. Picasso depicted his gorgeous lovers with green skin, eyes stacked horizontally, and noses protruding from their foreheads. His imaginative interpretation of beauty jars our senses, and while on the surface his abstract portraits may be perceived as “weird” or “ugly,” vibrationally his paintings irrevocably capture our attention. Young graffiti artist Basquiat’s work is not conventionally beautiful, but people connect to it fervently on an energetic level. When we experience art, we are examining the world through the artist’s perspective and experiencing his or her passion, intensity, and raw emotion. It resonates with us because on some level we acknowledge the artist’s ability to access their unique Soul Signature to produce those works of art. Regardless of our aesthetics, we accept it for what it is, relish the opportunity to share the artist’s light and expand our souls in the process.\nBy embodying their Soul Signature, great painters tap into a wellspring of inspiration and the result is not always water lilies on a tranquil Giverny pond. There is always a story behind a great work of art – a story that is at times painful, frightening, or even tragic. It may be difficult to look at or you may want to avoid it altogether but it’s the inclusion of the story, not the absence of it that makes the painting more moving and impactful. That engaging creative process can only occur when you’re in connection with your Soul Signature. The full magnitude of creativity flows most effortlessly when you’re in harmony of yourself and you start to see something beautiful in what you once thought was ugly. You begin to realize why you are who you are and start uncovering the masterpiece you were born to be.\nIn the eyes of the Divine, one artist is no better than another. Raushenburg is as brilliant as Rembrandt. It’s all art and all spirit, flowing freely onto life’s canvas and signed with individual fingerprints. Your Soul Signature vibrationally allows you to come into an awareness and harmony with your own artistic expression no matter the form it takes- wife, husband, mother, father, PhD, dog walker, etc. There is only recognition that you are your perfect self. Accessing your Soul Signature allows you to appreciate the masterpiece you are and lovingly embrace the self-portrait you see when you look in the mirror. What you see is not broken. Even with stacked eyes, green skin, and a misplaced nose, you are a glorious, celebrated work of art."

Deflation is the opposite – price decreases over time – but inflation is far more common.\nIf inflation is 10%, then a £50 pair of shoes will cost £55 in a year's time and £60.50 a year after that.\nInflation eats away at the value of wages and savings – if you earn 10% on your savings but inflation is 10%, the real rate of interest on your pot is actually 0%.\nA relatively new phenomenon, inflation has become a real worry for governments since the 1960s.\nAs a rule of thumb, times of high inflation are good for borrowers and bad for investors.\nMortgages are a good example of how borrowing can be advantageous – annual inflation of 10% over seven years halves the real value of a mortgage.\nOn the other hand, pensioners, who depend on a fixed income, watch the value of their assets erode.\nThe government's preferred measure of inflation, and the one the Bank of England takes into account when setting interest rates, is the consumer price index (CPI).\nThe retail prices index (RPI) is often used in wage negotiations.\nThe consumer prices index, due on Tuesday, is expected to rise to 2.8% for August, up from 2.6% in July, and close to the four-year high of 2.9% reached in June.\nTransport costs are likely to be one of the main drivers of higher inflation, as petrol and diesel have become more expensive in recent weeks.\nWages, though, are not keeping pace. City economists predict that Wednesday’s labour market statistics will show that average earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.2% per year in the three months to July. This would be an improvement on the 2.1% recorded a month ago, but still means that real wages are falling.\nAnalysts at Investec predict the UK unemployment rate could drop to 4.3%, the lowest in over four decades. But they caution that there are still no sign that wage growth is taking off.\nBusiness advisers BDO have warned that the rise in employment has not yet delivered higher productivity either.\nPeter Hemington, a partner at BDO, explained: “UK employment law is sufficiently elastic to give employers the comfort that they can flex workforces quickly as market conditions change.\nUnion leaders will renew their calls for the government to lift the 1% pay cap on public sector workers, when they gather for the Trades Union Congress in Brighton.\nThe Unison general secretary, Dave Prentis, said Theresa May’s administration was “out of step” with the national mood.\n“After seven long years of pay freezes and limits on their wages, ambulance workers, school meals staff, police and community support officers and other public service employees all deserve so much better,” Prentis said."

      "text": "Chicago is up next in our Team Talk series, this one also written by Adam Filadelfo. Follow him on Twitter: @Frostt24.\nAlways a potential to be a breakout offense, Da Bears seem to fall just a bit short. If this is the year they put it all together, you are going to want to own some of these players to help bring you a fantasy football championship.\nJay Cutler - Let me start off by saying Cutler has the tools to be an elite level quarterback. Now let me say that he isn't an elite level quarterback. Maybe it's his approach to the game or maybe it's his attitude, but something is holding him back. He has a great arm and sometimes looks like he's turned the corner, but just when it seems like he's put it all together he goes and throws an ill-advised pass that gets picked off. Maybe he thinks his big arm is all he needs. There were just too many games (last year especially) that Cutler either failed to show up or threw more interceptions than touchdowns. At this point, he's probably best suited as a backup fantasy quarterback.\nMatt Forte - Forte is more valuable in PPR formats simply because he is an important part of the passing game. But what hurts him most is his lack of scoring touchdowns. No matter what format you may play in, nothing is more valuable than touchdowns. That may be the only department Forte is at a disadvantage, and he certainly has room for improvement there. He's currently going in the second round of drafts and in a new system with new head coach Marc Trestman he could see a boost in touchdowns scored.\nBrandon Marshall - One word comes to mind when describing Marshall. Beast. Not only is he a weapon downfield, he's a strong red zone threat as well. Brandon is a physically gifted athlete with the ability to make outstanding plays but may need another wide receiver opposite him to reach his full potential.\nAlshon Jeffery - He showed signs of breaking out last season but never quite took that next step. Some are predicting this could be the year but I'm tempering my expectations. Marshall is clearly Cutler's favorite target and it sometimes seems Cutler only sees Marshall on the field. That could hurt the value of Jeffery even more. Until he shows he can do more than just flash signs of ability, I'd stay away. Unfulfilled promise makes him worthy of a late round flier in your drafts.\nMartellus Bennett - Bennett could have a really good year in Chicago. He's a legitimate red zone option in a season where tight end seems at a premium. He also gives Cutler another option at the goal line. He's an every week starter at his position that could very well help a Bears offense that had to settle for far too many field goals last season. Keep in mind that Marc Trestman is known for being an offensive minded coach so that could help boost Bennett's value.\nMichael Bush - He won't see much work as long as Matt Forte is healthy. That being said, there's a good chance Forte doesn't stay healthy for the entire season. If the Bears need him, Bush can produce. Even with Forte in there, Bush has been more of the goal line back and could be valuable by means of scoring touchdowns. Only problem with that is it's almost impossible to predict touchdowns. I think right now, Bush is worth drafting as the clear cut handcuff for Forte owners. He probably won't hold much value for any other fantasy owner.\nDevin Hester - Let's get this out of the way right now: The Devin Hester as a receiver experiment has failed. However, in fantasy leagues where owners are rewarded for return yards, Hester could still hold some value. Hester is one of the most electrifying return specialists to play in the NFL in quite some time. Any time he has the ball in his hands, there's a good chance he can take it to the house. In most leagues if you want to get the benefit of Hester's return ability, you're going to want to draft the Bears defense and special teams.\nD/ST - Make no mistake about it, the Bears defense will be one of the first defenses off the board come draft day. Only problem with defenses is an elite defense one year isn't necessarily that the following year. What made the Chicago defense so great to own in 2012 was their penchant for getting turnovers. You can't count on that happening again, but the potential remains. Regardless of that though, you should be confident using the Bears defense in most matchups."

      "text": "Hi there lovelies, long time no see. I have been testing quite a number of products the past few weeks, and since COSRX has been gaining quite a bit of attention recently, I decided to do a review focusing on this brand itself. Many followers on Instagram also asked for my opinions regarding COSRX products. Today I will share with you my opinions on the product that I have been tested for approximately 2 months now: COSRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid. Stay tuned for my future review for BHA Blackhead Power Liquid, and Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence.\nBefore we started, I have a confession: I am absolutely in love with COSRX as a brand. Their ingredients list is relatively short and pretty straight forwards. Products is fragrance free, paraben free and coloring free, which is a huge plus for sensitive and acne-prone skin like mine. After using their products for a while now, I am confident to say that my skin has been greatly strengthened and healing process happens much faster for the aftermath of my acne fighting, scars fade faster, skin texture is less bumpy and I am indeed a much happier girl 🙂 My goal is to finish the rest of my skincare and convert all my products to COSRX and COSRX only. Yup, I am absolutely in love. Now I shall share in details about the product that I have been tested.\nAHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid clears away old dead skin cells trapped inside the pores. Works alongside vitamins, whiteners and natural moisturizer treatments. Managing dead skin cells without unnecessary stimulation. Helping skin management while creating healthier skin with more vitality. Star ingredients Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water: An alpha-hydroxy acid naturally-occurring found in sugar cane and malic acid, derived from apples, which will help to exfoliate dead skin cells, reduce the appearance of fine lines, sun damage and hyper-pigmentation, diminish the appearance of large pores and acne scarring. A great ingredient for reducing blackheads, whiteheads and troubles on skin. It even moisturizes the skin at same time as removing dead skin cells. You will find your skin is smooth, soft, and comfortable.\n1) Moisture, pore control, and brightening. It immediately purifies and tones up your skin leaving is clearer and more bright.\n2) Whitehead clearance. No more difficulty removing whiteheads and sebum !\n3) AHA product with hyaluronic acid. It controls excessive sebum and achieves excellent moisture retention in combination with hyaluronic acid.\n4) AHA for repairing skin damage. Works well for sun damaged skin. Also it is good for spots, dryness and trouble.\nThe product is packaged in a very simple and straightforward packaging, just like the formula itself. Even though it might deemed to be a little bit bland for my aesthetics, I honestly do not mind it that much. The functional aspects of the packaging is strong, with sturdy packaging, excellent quality pumps that is designed nicely. One pump is enough for my entire face.\nEven though the product claims to have Apple Fruit Water as the first and start ingredients, I was so put off with the smell at first. The smell was so pungent and strong and definitely does not smell anything like apple. Overtime I get used to the smell a little bit, but I can’t help but stop inhaling whenever I apply this product all over my face.\n5) AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid is high concentrated product. Please use a small amount on areas with whiteheads and dead skin cells. Begin with using only once a week, and after skin has adjusted, use 2 to 3 times a week to maintain clear skin without dead skin cells, sebum and whiteheads.\n6) When you use AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid, do not use other exfoliating products on same day.\nI did not want to mess with the caution, so I use this on alternate with the Blackhead Power Liquid, and notice great results. I normally use this after my toner step, when my skin is perfectly cleansed and balanced. After waiting for 20-30 mins, I move on with a hydrating essence/serum, followed by sheet mask, light gel cream and sleeping pack. It is important that other products following your acid treatment step are all hydrating to help sooth the skin after the treatment.\nIt is an extremely light-weight texture that is as runny as water. The liquid absorbed onto my skin with minimal efforts, a little bit of tapping with help it absorbs much faster.\nThis using in conjunction with the Blackhead Power Liquid improved my skin significantly over the past 2 months. I must say, my skin has never do so well for the longest time ever. All my acnes and pimples are in control, scars are fading quick and most importantly, those funny bumpy texture on my skin is gone. Now since I use this together with the Blackhead Power Liquid, it is hard to identify which problems is solved by which products, but I believe this controls stuffs that happen more on the surface of your skin.\nYes I will, together with Blackhead Power Liquid as a duo as these are the best treatment I have found in years.\nThanks for your review I really love it ❤️ But I want to ask you this to make sure 🙂 I currently order 3 products : 1/klair vitamin c , 2/Cosrx aha 7 power liquid , 3/Cosrx bha power liquid. As you say that you use it alternately so I want to know that can I use it like this ? Ex: on Monday I use aha and Tuesday I use klair vitamin c and Wednesday bha. Is it okay to use it like?\nIf I use them for the first time I only use them once a week first right?"

      "text": "You only get one chance to make a first impression, which is why a good introduction goes a long way. With this in mind, we’re excited to debut a new Welcome Email option to help administrators introduce TigerText to new users.\nWe aimed to keep the content simple and visual. There’s a space where each organization can write a welcome message for new users, and Admins can customize the header, for example by adding their organization’s logo. The email is formatted to look good on both desktop and mobile. The Get Started button guides mobile users to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, while sending desktop users to the TigerText web console.\nAdmins can set the Welcome Email to be automatic for newly added users or leave it manual for more control of who receives the message and when. To help admins track progress toward adoption, we’ve also added an Activation Status column in the Users Tab to show whether a user has received a Welcome Email and when they activate their account.\nWe designed this feature to help organizations encourage staff to use TigerText sooner. Because everyone benefits when more coworkers join the conversation in less time: organizations protect more information, staff members save more time and enjoy simpler collaboration, and overall the workplace makes decisions faster. We think that’s a welcome outcome.\nHow to access this feature:Admins can customize and send the new Welcome Email from the Org Settings Tab."
